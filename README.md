## Personal website for logging training sessions with a twist, each session gives points that can be redeemed in the "shop"
Only for personal use so basic implementation of a back-end with supabase-js
This project is useless for anyone else. 

# note to self
supabase has row level security when authenication via supabase is used
could be made nicer with frameworks, but looks very good and is very simple and minimal now without.
